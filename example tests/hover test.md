  -------------------------
  Be in Read Mode (Ctrl+E) to hover and view other markdowns ^ReadNote
- [single braket test] does nothing
- \[[ [[double bracket test]] \]\]
	- seems like logseq always shows the brackets so heres [[double bracket test]]
	- somehow it goe italisized
		- maybe its the escapes?
- [[#hashtagetest]]
	- dont think #tags need brackets
- \[[PageName#^link]] block takes you to another part of the page. Ex: [[hover test#^ReadNote]]
	- probably a different way to do this too will need to find out later
- \[[change what before the pipe | shows this instead ]\]  [[Can't see this | but shows this]]
  [[double bracket test|Example Text Displayed for this page link]]
	- once again, maybe another way?
