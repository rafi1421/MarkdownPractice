- I stumbled across Logseq about a month after discovering Obsidian, and love what I see so far! Here are my initial thoughts comparing the two:
- Compelling reasons are ==highlighted==
- [[LogSeq]] is better for:
	- Outlining
	- Journalling
	- ==To do list / [[Task management]]==
	- Linking to paragraphs and focus mode
	- Using from a browser
		- ==using at work== via browser and github
	- Look and feel
	- simplicity
	- Slideshow
- [[Obsidian]] is better for:
	- Platform stability (more mature)
		- Mobile platform (this may change)
	- ==Data backup==
	- plugins
	- Graph and local graph
		- nodes are hyperlinked
	- Search
	- embedding pics (just unsure how to do this on Logseq yet)
	- Templates (untested)
- Things which are different and interesting
	- Tags
		- Obsidian tags are traditional
		- Logseq tags are like links
